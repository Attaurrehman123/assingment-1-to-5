            <h1> KARACHI</h1>
            Karachi (/kəˈrɑːtʃi/; Urdu: کراچی; Sindhi: ڪراچي; IPA: [kəˈraːtʃi] (listen)) is the most populous city in Pakistan and 12th most populous city in the world, with a population of over 20 million.[17][18][19] It is situated at the southern tip of the country along the Arabian Sea coast. It is the former capital of Pakistan and capital of the province of Sindh. Ranked as a beta-global city,[20][21] it is Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre,[22] with an estimated GDP of over $200 billion (PPP) as of 2021.[15][16] Karachi paid $9 billion (25% of whole country) as tax during fiscal year July 2021 to May 2022 according to FBR report. Karachi is Pakistan's most cosmopolitan city, linguistically, ethnically, and religiously diverse,[23] as well as one of Pakistan's most socially liberal cities.[24][25][26] Karachi serves as a transport hub, and contains Pakistan's two largest seaports, the Port of Karachi and Port Qasim, as well as Pakistan's busiest airport, Jinnah International Airport.[27] Karachi is also a media center, home to news channels, film and fashion industry of Pakistan. Most of Pakistan's multinational companies and banks have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also a tourism hub due to its scenic beaches, historic buildings and shopping malls.

The region has been inhabited for millennia,[28] but the city was formally founded as the fortified village of Kolachi as recently as 1729.[29][30] The settlement greatly increased in importance on arrival of the East India Company in the mid-19th century. British administrators embarked on substantial projects to transform the city into a major seaport, and connect it with the extensive railway network of the Indian subcontinent.[30] At the time of the partition of India in 1947, the city was the largest in Sindh with an estimated population of 400,000 people.[23] Following the independence of Pakistan, the city experienced a dramatic shift in population and demography with the arrival of hundreds of thousands of Muhajir (Urdu-speaking people) Muslim refugees from India,[31] coupled with a substantial exodus of its Hindu residents, whose numbers declined from 51.1% to 1.7% of the total population.[32][33] The city experienced rapid economic growth following Pakistan's independence, attracting migrants from throughout the country and other regions in South Asia.[34] According to the 2017 Census of Pakistan, Karachi's total population was 16,051,521, with 14.9 million of those people residing in the urban areas of the city. Karachi is one of the world's fastest-growing cities,[35] and has significant communities representing almost every ethnic group in Pakistan. Karachi holds more than two million Bengali immigrants, a million Afghan refugees, and up to 400,000 Rohingyas from Myanmar.[36][37][38]

Karachi is now Pakistan's premier industrial and financial centre. The city has a formal economy estimated to be worth $190 billion as of 2021, which is the largest in the country.[39][40] Karachi collects 35% of Pakistan's tax revenue,[41] and generates approximately 25% of Pakistan's entire GDP.[42][43] Approximately 30% of Pakistani industrial output is from Karachi,[44] while Karachi's ports handle approximately 95% of Pakistan's foreign trade.[45] Approximately 90% of the multinational corporations and 100% of banks operating in Pakistan are headquartered in Karachi.[45] Karachi is considered to be Pakistan's fashion capital,[46][47] and has hosted the annual Karachi Fashion Week since 2009.[48][49]

Known as the "City of Lights" in the 1960s and 1970s for its vibrant nightlife,[50] Karachi was beset by sharp ethnic, sectarian, and political conflict in the 1980s with the large-scale arrival of weaponry during the Soviet–Afghan War.[51] The city had become well known for its high rates of violent crime, but recorded crimes sharply decreased following a crackdown operation against criminals, the MQM political party, and Islamist militants, initiated in 2013 by the Pakistan Rangers.[52] As a result of the operation, Karachi dropped from being ranked the world's 6th-most dangerous city for crime in 2014, to 128th by 2022.[53]
<h1> climate</h1>
Karachi has a hot desert climate (Köppen: BWh) dominated by a long "Summer Season" while moderated by oceanic influence from the Arabian Sea. The city has low annual average precipitation levels (approx. 174 mm (7 in) per annum), the bulk of which occurs during the July–August monsoon season. Summers are hot and humid, and Karachi is prone to deadly heatwaves.[125] On the other hand, cool sea breezes typically provide relief during hot summer months. A text message-based early warning system alerts people to take precautionary measures and helps prevent fatalities during an unusually strong heatwave or thunderstorm.[126] The winter climate is dry and lasts between December and February. It is dry and pleasant in winter relative to the warm hot season that follows, which starts in March and lasts until October. Proximity to the sea maintains humidity levels at near-constant levels year-round. Thus, the climate is similar to a humid tropical climate except for low precipitation and occasional temperatures well over 100 F (38 C) due to dry continental influence.

The city's highest monthly rainfall, 19 in (480 mm), occurred in July 1967.[127][128] The city's highest rainfall in 24 hours occurred on 7 August 1953, when about 278.1 millimetres (10.95 in) of rain lashed the city, resulting in major flooding.[129]

Karachi's highest recorded temperature is 47.8 °C (118.0 °F) which was recorded on 9 May 1938,[130] and the lowest is 0 °C (32 °F) recorded on 21 January 1934.[128]

<h1>finance and economy</h1>
Karachi is Pakistan's financial and commercial capital.[137] Since Pakistan's independence, Karachi has been the centre of the nation's economy, and remain's Pakistan's largest urban economy despite the economic stagnation caused by sociopolitical unrest during the late 1980s and 1990s. The city forms the centre of an economic corridor stretching from Karachi to nearby Hyderabad, and Thatta.[138]

As of 2021, Karachi had an estimated GDP (PPP) of $190 billion with a yearly growth rate of 5.5%.[139][40] Karachi contributes 90% of Sindh's GDP[140][141][142][143] and accounts for approximately 25% of the total GDP of Pakistan.[42][43] The city has a large informal economy which is not typically reflected in GDP estimates.[144] The informal economy may constitute up to 36% of Pakistan's total economy, versus 22% of India's economy, and 13% of the Chinese economy.[145] The informal sector employs up to 70% of the city's workforce.[146] In 2018 The Global Metro Monitor Report ranked Karachi's economy as the best performing metropolitan economy in Pakistan.[147]

Today along with Pakistan's continued economic expansion Karachi is now ranked third in the world for consumer expenditure growth with its market anticipated to increase by 6.6% in real terms in 2018[148] It is also ranked among the top cities in the world by an anticipated increase of a number of households (1.3 million households) with annual income above $20,000 dollars measured at PPP exchange rates by 2025.[149] The Global FDI Intelligence Report 2017/2018 published by Financial Times ranks Karachi amongst the top 10 Asia pacific cities of the future for FDI strategy.[150] According to Anatol Lieven the economic growth of Karachi is a result of the influx of Muhajirs to Karachi during late 1940s and early 50s.[151]

Finance and banking
Most of Pakistan's public and private banks are headquartered on Karachi's I. I. Chundrigar Road, which is known as "Pakistan's Wall Street",[2] with a large percentage of the cash flow in the Pakistani economy taking place on I. I. Chundrigar Road. Most major foreign multinational corporations operating in Pakistan have their headquarters in Karachi. Karachi is also home to the Pakistan Stock Exchange, which was rated as Asia's best-performing stock market in 2015 on the heels of Pakistan's upgrade to emerging-market status by MSCI.[152]

Karachi has been the pioneer in cable networking in Pakistan with the most sophisticated of the cable networks of any city of Pakistan,[153] and has seen an expansion of information and communications technology and electronic media. The city has become a software outsourcing hub for Pakistan.[citation needed] Several independent television and radio stations are based in Karachi, including Business Plus, AAJ News, Geo TV, KTN,[154] Sindh TV,[155] CNBC Pakistan, TV ONE, Express TV,[156] ARY Digital, Indus Television Network, Samaa TV, Abb Takk News, Bol TV, and Dawn News, as well as several local stations.

Industry
Industry contributes a large portion of Karachi's economy, with the city home to several of Pakistan's largest companies dealing in textiles, cement, steel, heavy machinery, chemicals, and food products.[157] The city is home to approximately 30 percent of Pakistan's manufacturing sector,[44] and produces approximately 42 percent of Pakistan's value added in large scale manufacturing.[158] At least 4500 industrial units form Karachi's formal industrial economy.[159] Karachi's informal manufacturing sector employs far more people than the formal sector, though proxy data suggest that the capital employed and value-added from such informal enterprises is far smaller than that of formal sector enterprises.[160] An estimated 63% of the Karachi's workforce is employed in trade and manufacturing.[138]

Karachi Export Processing Zone, SITE, Korangi, Northern Bypass Industrial Zone, Bin Qasim and North Karachi serve as large industrial estates in Karachi.[161] The Karachi Expo Centre also complements Karachi's industrial economy by hosting regional and international exhibitions.[1

<h1> cuisine of karachi</h1>\
arachi cuisine (Urdu: کراچی پکوان) refers to the food found mainly in the city of Karachi, Sindh, Pakistan. It is a multicultural cuisine as a result of the city consisting of various ethnic groups from different parts of Pakistan.[1] Karachi is considered the melting pot of Pakistan.[2]

The cuisine of Karachi is strongly influenced by the city's Muhajir population, who came from various parts of British India and settled primarily in Karachi after the independence of Pakistan in 1947. Most Urdu speaking Muslims have traditionally been based in Karachi, hence the city is known for multi cultural tastes in its cuisine. These Muslims maintained their old established culinary traditions, including variety of dishes and beverages.

Karachi cuisine is renowned for its cultural fusion, due to various empires and peoples living in this mega city. As a result many multi ethnic cuisines collaboratively had an influence on the style of Karachi food. The Pakistani cuisines such as Sindhi cuisine, Punjabi cuisine, Pashtun cuisine, Kalash cuisine, Saraiki cuisine, Kashmiri cuisine, Balochi cuisine, Chitrali cuisine and other regional cuisines have also influenced the cuisine of Karachi.
