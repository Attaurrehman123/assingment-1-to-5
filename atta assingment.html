<p> Whether you’re building a conference website from scratch or want to hire a designer to do the design for you, this handpicked collection is never a waste of time. Here’s Aiga Design Conference that you can take a look into. It’s the biggest event of the year for all creatives across the country. The homepage has a nice design and looks elegant with a black background and red web elements. The hero header has an attractive design too – bold typography for the headline and clear CTA. Below the hero scene is a multiple displays of images highlighted using a smooth slider. In the same way, this website also utilizes a seamless slider for the speakers’ presentation. In addition, the social media icons on the footer never missed its role in the site’s success</p>
